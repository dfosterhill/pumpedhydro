# Theoretical Development
Ok, let us begin with the figure below. There are two large reservoirs of water and a pump is going to be used to move the water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. The pipe length is $L$, the pipe diameter is $d$, the *roughness height* of the pipe material (cast iron, steel, etc.) is $\epsilon$, and there is an elevation difference of $\Delta z = z_{2}-z_{1}$ between the reservoir free surfaces.
