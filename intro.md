# Introduction to Pumped Storage
Production and consumption of energy are fairly straightforward concepts. We generate electricity via solar, nuclear, and many other methods. Consumers (commercial, residential, etc.) then use this energy for various purposes. The tricky part is matching up rates of production with rates on consumption. When these rates do not match, it can lead to *rolling outages* or *brown-outs*. One example of this is during [heat waves](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1121427449/an-intense-heat-wave-in-california-is-stressing-the-states-power-grid), when the electrical grid can not keep up with the energy needed for cooling of homes. Another issue has to do with what are called [transmission losses](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&t=3). Basically, if energy has to be sent far away from where it is generated, there is a fairly steep penalty to be paid.  

The bottom line is that there is significant need for the *storage* of energy. At to meet this need, which is increasing as renewables increase in scale and number, [battery storage](https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-boost-for-renewables-grid-scale-battery-storage-is-on-the-rise) facilities are being constructed. Many of these facilities use actual batteries, such as the image below from Pullman, Washington.
