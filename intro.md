# Introduction to Pumped Storage
Production and consumption of energy are fairly straightforward concepts. We generate electricity via solar, nuclear, and many other methods. Consumers (commercial, residential, etc.) then use this energy for various purposes. The tricky part is matching up rates of production with rates on consumption. When these rates do not match, it can lead to *rolling outages* or *brown-outs*. One example of this is during [heat waves](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1121427449/an-intense-heat-wave-in-california-is-stressing-the-states-power-grid), when the electrical grid can not keep up with the energy needed for cooling of homes. Another issue has to do with what are called [transmission losses](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&t=3). Basically, if energy has to be sent far away from where it is generated, there is a fairly steep penalty to be paid.  

The bottom line is that there is significant need for the *storage* of energy. At to meet this need, which is increasing as renewables increase in scale and number, [battery storage](https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-boost-for-renewables-grid-scale-battery-storage-is-on-the-rise) facilities are being constructed. Many of these facilities use actual batteries, such as the image below from Pullman, Washington.

Another way of storing energy has to do with *potential energy*. Remember that $PE = mgz$ where $m$ is mass, $g$ is gravity, and $z$ is elevation. So by raising a mass to a higher elevation we increase its potential energy, i.e. we store energy. When we want that energy back we simply allow that mass to move to a lower elevation and recover its potential energy. Now, one consideration here has to do with the *losses* (friction and other) associated with moving this mass up and then back down. If the losses are dramatic, then the storage scheme can quickly become undesirable.

In principle any mass could be used in this storage concept. In practice, [water](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1126523766/water-batteries-could-store-solar-and-wind-power-for-when-its-needed) is often used, and this is called *pumped storage* or *pumped hydro*. The essential idea is this. You have two bodies of water (reservoirs) at different elevations. When you have a suplus of energy, or when energy is cheap, you use a pump to move water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. When you have a demand for energy, or when energy is more expensive, you allow the water to flow from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir though an energy-generating turbine. The image below is a pumped storage system in South Africa, called the Steenbras Dams.

Pumped storage can be used in one of two ways. It can be used solely for the purposes of smoothing out the imbalance between energy generation and energy demand. Or, it can be used to turn a profit. Some areas have *tiered* energy pricing, where energy may be very cheap in the middle of the night, for example, but much more costly during peak usage hours. In this case, cheap energy at night could be used to move water uphill, and the water could be released downhill during peak usage, when the electricity could be sold at a premium rate.

There are two other documents in this repository. One will walk through the fluid mechanics / hydraulics needed to analyze this problem. The other will set up and then solve a simple example problem.
