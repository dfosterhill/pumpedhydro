# Pumped Hydro
This repository contains some very basic information about what is called pumped storage, or pumped hydro. I suggest you go in the following order
1. Review the very brief [*introduction*](intro.md) on what pumped hydro is.
2. Review the relevant fluid mechanics theory on a simple pumped hydro system.
3. See short notes on an example problem.
4. Run the matlab script for this example problem

Enjoy.
