# Example
In the figure below, we see a simple system. Water can be pumped uphill by the pump. Or, water can flow downhill through the turbine. We are going to assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the *performance curve* of the pump is the same as the turbine. In other words, the turbine is a perfect *reverse image* of the pump. Next, we are not going to worry about pump or turbine in-efficiencies; we are just going to deal with theoretical values of supplied pump power and extracted turbine power.
